# About Me
Hi everyone, my name is Evy. I am a recent graduate in Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am from Mozambique, but I moved to the U.S to do university. Honestly, one of the best decisions of my life. Overtime, I started to get more involved with research projects, and I found out that I love building mobile applications. At the moment, I have only worked so far with Android IDE, but hopefully I will start working with IOS. In addition, I found out that I love doing forex trading, and learn about it. <br><br>In this repository, I will include facts about me, my resume, and things I want to share about myself. <br>
